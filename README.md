## Introduction

This repository serves as a learning platform for Java enthusiasts who want to deepen their understanding of software development principles and Java ecosystem technologies. Through a series of hands-on examples and detailed explanations, learners can explore the concepts of loose coupling, the Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and game development.

## Loose Coupling in Java

Loose coupling is a design goal that seeks to reduce the interdependencies among components of a system, making it more modular and easier to refactor or replace components. This section covers:

- **Basic Java Interfaces**: How to use interfaces to achieve polymorphism and reduce coupling.
- **Spring Framework**: Utilizing Spring's Dependency Injection (DI) to manage object creation and dependencies.

## Spring Framework Basics

The Spring Framework is an essential tool for building Java applications. In this section, we explore:

- **Core Concepts**: Understanding Spring's core principles, including Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI).
- **Configuration**: A look at XML-based and Annotation-based configurations.

## Building a REST API with Spring Boot

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications. This section guides you through:

- **Setup**: Setting up a Spring Boot project.
- **Developing RESTful Services**: Creating simple RESTful services with Spring Boot.

## Quiz Game

A simple Java-based quiz game demonstrating:

- **Game Logic**: Implementing the core game mechanics.
- **User Interaction**: Handling user input and feedback.

## Rock Paper Scissors Game

An implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game showcasing:

- **Decision Structures**: Utilizing decision-making constructs in Java.

## FizzBuzz CLI App
 A simple program that prints numbers from n to 1, but for multiples of three prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five prints "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".
- **Testing**: Basic testing principles methods.

## Mortgage Calculator CLI App
 An application that calculates the monthly payments for a fixed-rate mortgage over a given loan term, demonstrating basic Java arithmetic operations and input handling.
- **Testing**: Basic testing principles for methods.
